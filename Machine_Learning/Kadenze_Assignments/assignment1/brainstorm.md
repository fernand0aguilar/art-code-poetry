## GETTING STARTED WITH MACHINE LEARNING - PART 2

### **Written Component**

Brainstorm 3 scenarios in which supervised learning could be used to make a piece of interactive art or music. Each of your three scenarios should be between 100-300 words.

Specifically, describe:

**A. What input devices or sensors might you use?** _(These don’t have to be things that you own! Think big.)_
```

```
**B. What do you imagine changing the state of these sensors/devices?** _(e.g., motions of a person, state of the environment, ... ?)_
```

```
**C. What output processes might you use?** _(e.g., changing the melody or timbre of a sound, changing the position or color of an animated object, or something much more complicated. This doesn’t have to be something you know how to do as a programmer!)_
```

```

**D. How do changes in the input relate to changes in the output?** _That is, how do the motions of a person drive changes in a computer generated melody? Or how do changes in the amount of traffic on a street influence changes in an animated character? etc..._
```

```
**E. Say a little bit about your motivation.** _If you came up with this system because you thought it would be interesting / useful / fun / otherwise a good idea._
```
